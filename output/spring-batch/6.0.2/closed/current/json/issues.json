    "body": "**Bug description**\nWhen using a `StaxEventItemWriter` in combination with a `MultiResourceItemWriter`, a `ClosedChannelException` is thrown with following stacktrace:\n\n```\nCaused by: java.nio.channels.ClosedChannelException: null\n    at java.base/sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.ensureOpen(FileChannelImpl.java:160) ~[na:na]\n    at java.base/sun.nio.ch.FileChannelImpl.write(FileChannelImpl.java:284) ~[na:na]\n    at org.springframework.batch.support.transaction.TransactionAwareBufferedWriter$1.complete(TransactionAwareBufferedWriter.java:121) ~[spring-batch-infrastructure-5.2.4.jar:5.2.4]\n    at org.springframework.batch.support.transaction.TransactionAwareBufferedWriter$1.beforeCommit(TransactionAwareBufferedWriter.java:106) ~[spring-batch-infrastructure-5.2.4.jar:5.2.4]\n    ... 44 common frames omitted\n```\n\nThis only occurs as long as `StaxEventItemWriter` is configured to be transactional. After debugging some more it seemd to be related to the `endDocument()` method  running after the writer has been closed, but I'm not sure if this is really the case.\n\n**Environment**\nReproducible in multiple versions of Spring Batch (including 5.2.3, 6.0.0) on Java 21\n\n**Steps to reproduce**\n1. Define a `StaxEventItemWriter`:\n\n    ```java\n    @Bean\n    public StaxEventItemWriter<Foo> fooWriter() {\n        return new StaxEventItemWriterBuilder<Foo>()\n            .name(\"fooWriter\")\n            .marshaller(marshaller())\n            .rootTagName(\"foos\")\n            // Note, in Spring Batch 6.0, it seems to be required to pass a `resource` within the builder\n            // even though it isn't used  due to being overriden by the `MultiResourceItemWriter`\n            .resource(new FileSystemResource(\"foo/foo.xml\"))\n            .build();\n    }\n    ```\n\n2. Define a `MultiResourceItemWriter`:\n\n    ```java\n    @Bean\n    public MultiResourceItemWriter<Foo> multiFooWriter() {\n        return new MultiResourceItemWriterBuilder<Foo>()\n            .name(\"multiFooWriter\")\n            .delegate(fooWriter())\n            .itemCountLimitPerResource(100)\n            .resourceSuffixCreator(index -> \"-\" + index + \".xml\")\n            .resource(new FileSystemResource(\"foo\"))\n            .build();\n    }\n    ```\n\n3. Define a `Job` using this `MultiResourceItemWriter` and run it. It will result in the aforementioned stack trace. When I set `.transactional(false)` within the `StaxEventItemWriter`, the batch succeeds.\n\n**Expected behavior**\nI expect 100 XML files to be created (reader produces 10.000 items and writer creates a separate file per 100 items). \n\n**Minimal Complete Reproducible example**\n[GitHub Repository](https://github.com/g00glen00b/spring-batch-multiresource-stax-reader-transactional-issue/)\n\n**Additional notes**\nRelevant Stack Overflow thread I created: [link](https://stackoverflow.com/q/79825366)\nIn this Stack Overflow thread it was discussed that this might be intentional behavior. If that's the case, I could send a PR to mention this in the documentation somewhere.\n",
