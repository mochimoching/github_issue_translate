## 内容

Our prototype with Spring Native has shown that working with multiple statements and/or code blocks can lead to repetitive code. Also, JavaPoet does not resolve imports on code snippet so that makes code assertion a bit awkward. 

this issue is about porting those utilities in `spring-core` so that we can benefit from it.
