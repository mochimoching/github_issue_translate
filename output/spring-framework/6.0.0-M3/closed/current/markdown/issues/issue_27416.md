## 内容

This is the first version that officially supports JDK17 source and target compatibility level (see eclipse/org.aspectj#79).

Right now, we've downgraded the language level to 1.8 in aspectj Gradle tasks. Closing this issue would involve reverting the changes to the `compileAspectj` and `compileTestAspectj` tasks in `spring-aspects.gradle`.

We're tracking the AspectJ 1.9.8 RCs in spring-projects/spring-framework#27537 (for 6.0 M1), so I'm repurposing this ticket for AspectJ 1.9.8 GA (in 6.0 M2).

Hello AspectJ team, so is the GA for version 1.9.8, that will be the first GA for Java 17, currently depending on the optimization @sbrannen mentioned 25 days ago ?

No @philjoseph, that optimisation is already merged. Actually, we had stable versions for 1.9.8 - currently RC3 - for a long time and could have declared any of them final. Actually, I wanted to celebrate my committer status for AspectJ by cutting the release, even though technically it is not necessary, because I can already deploy to Maven Central ob behalf of the organisation. I just cannot directly commit and always have to trigger Andy Clement to merge my PRs for every little commit. Because internal Eclipse processes are rather Byzyntine, I still do not have committer status for AspectJ proper (only for AJDT), so I simply did not "push the release button". Sorry to have no more exciting (feature-wise) or better justified excuse for you. Maybe I should just deploy a release. For further oprimisations (Andy fixed a few minor bugs since 1.9.8.RC3), there is always the next release. But if you simply want to use Java 17, just use RC3. It does not contain the optimisation you talked about yet, though. That will be in the next Maven Central version.

FTR we've decided to backport this to `5.3.x` as well, see #28060
