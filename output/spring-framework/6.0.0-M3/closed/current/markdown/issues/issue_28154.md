## 内容

When a constructor should be invoked to create a bean instance, there is the danger that several flavors exist with different parameter types so that the call to `new MyBean(attributes.get(0)` is ambiguous as the type is not declared.

There is an explicit check for this case where an explicit type-based method on `InjectedElementAttributes` is used. Unfortunately, it hasn't been applied to factory methods that suffer from the same problem if several methods have a similar signature.
