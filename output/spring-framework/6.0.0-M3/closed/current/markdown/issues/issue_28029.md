## 内容

`BeanDefinitionValueResolver` is package private at the moment and the AOT engine could use calling it directly to resolve constructur arguments typically. 

We could also improve the current usage where a default `TypeConverter` can be provided by default as the current pattern uses a protected method of the bean factory to initialize it.
