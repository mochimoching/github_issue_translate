## 内容

Spring Native has a component called `NativeConfigurationRegistry` that offers a programmatic API to register the need for reflection, resources that are to be shipped in the native image, proxies as well as classes that should be `Serializable`.

We'd like to revisit this contract and make less native specific as we believe that such information could be useful elsewhere.

Such an infrastructure could land in `spring-core` as it is rather high-level and focused on classes and resources. The actual processing of the registry, for instance, to write GraalVM-specific configuration files is not in the scope of this issue.
