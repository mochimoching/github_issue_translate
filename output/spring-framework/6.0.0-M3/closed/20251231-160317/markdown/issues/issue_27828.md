## 内容

Our AOT processing needs a code generation library and we're quite happy using JavaPoet in Spring Native. It would be quite unusual for the core container to have a direct dependency on a third-party so the plan is to jarjar it in `org.springframework.javapoet` in the `spring-core` module.

We've decided to depend on JavaPoet directly for now with an optional dependency in modules that require it.

With our design evolving where certain components can provide both the regular runtime behavior and something that can generate a pre-processed version of it, it became apparent that it's odd to rely on an optional dependency of javapoet. 

We've decided to give the repackaging another try.
