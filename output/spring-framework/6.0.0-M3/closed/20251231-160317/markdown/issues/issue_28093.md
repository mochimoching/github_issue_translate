## 内容

There are more places where we need to create a `beanName` for an inner bean definition so rather than copy/pasting those, it would be better to have that logic in a single place.

I was under the impression I could add that in `BeanFactoryUtils` but this introduces a package tangle. @jhoeller any idea?

It turns out that the way a `RootBeanDefinition` for an inner bean is required and it goes beyons getting a bean name for it. I've updated the issue accordingly.
