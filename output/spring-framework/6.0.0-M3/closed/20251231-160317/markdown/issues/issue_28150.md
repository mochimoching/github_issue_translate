## 内容

Based on https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28065 and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/28088, we are now capable of creating an entry point for processing a `GenericApplicationContext` ahead of time. 

The generator refreshes the context for AOT processing  first, and then identifies the relevant contributions that are applicable for contributed bean definitions. It then invokes them so that code and runtime hints are contributed.
