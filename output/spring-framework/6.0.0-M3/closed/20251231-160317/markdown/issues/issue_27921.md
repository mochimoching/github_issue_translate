## 内容

`InjectionMetadata`  provides some information we could use at build-time. For instance, if `AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor` is enabled for the `ApplicationContext` that app uses without AOT, we should be able to find out about `autowired` elements, potentially even reusing any custom configuration that was set on the post processor.

There is also some logic in the way injection works that we may need to streamline to be consistent.

We're trying to design an interface that allows a `BeanPostProcessor` to opt-in for providing a code contributor that replaces what it does at runtime. The current model is implementing an interface that returns a contributor based on a `RootBeanDefinition`, similar to `MergedBeanDefinitionPostProcessor#postProcessMergedBeanDefinition`.

While the processor would be excluded by default at runtime, it would be nice if it could indicate that it needs to run again.  If we want such a feature, the phase at which the `BeanFactory` is processed should become a high-level concept, something like "build-time" vs. "runtime" vs. "optimized-runtime".

We need #28047 to move forward on this one.
