Spring Context Support is using _javax.mail:javax.mail-api_ and _javax.activation:javax.activation-api_. Meanwhile there is _com.sun.mail:jakarta.mail_ and _com.sun.activation:jakarta.activation_.

We generally compile against baseline APIs, not necessarily against the latest... except for cases where we need (optional) dependencies on newer interfaces, like with Servlet 4.0 where we compile against 4.0 while retaining 3.1 compatibility at runtime. From that perspective, I see us hanging on to the common EE 7/8 API artifacts as a baseline for the time being.

Is there a specific reason why you'd like us to switch to the Jakarta-provided artifacts? A concrete application project can bring in the Jakarta variant at runtime in any case since we are not enforcing the Oracle-provided artifacts, in particular not for optional dependencies, just using them for compilation purposes as the common reference APIs out there.

OK, got it. I thought that you are compiling against the latest API versions.

@spring-issuemaster , what is the correct way to tell spring CDI that `jakarta.inject.Inject` plays the same role as `javax.inject.Inject`?

I've researched a lot aboud this topic and haven't figured out an elegant solution for it. Please note that `@AliasFor` isn't an option because I can't annotate jakarta packages.
