`AbstractJpaVendorAdapter` refers to JPA 2.1 but it now requires JPA 3.0. Similarly, `HibernateJpaVendorAdapter` describes support for Hibernate 5.2, 5.3, and 5.4. I believe it now requires a minimum of 5.5 as that's the earliest version that has `-jakarta` variants of its modules and supports JPA 3.0.
