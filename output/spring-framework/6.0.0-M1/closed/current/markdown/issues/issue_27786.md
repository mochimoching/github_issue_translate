## 内容

The [JAMon](https://github.com/stevensouza/jamonapi) project doesn't seem really active anymore. Last update was (almost) 2 years ago, by the time Spring 6 will be released this will be 3 years. I'm not even sure if it fully supports new java versions or API versions released after that. 

In the current day and age there are more sophisticated solutions like JavaMelody, Micrometer, Sentry.io to name a few. It might be of consideration to drop this native support (maybe donate the interceptor to the JAMon project).
