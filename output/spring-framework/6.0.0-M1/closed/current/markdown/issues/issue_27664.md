## 内容

On a related note to gh-27646, our `EncodedResource` should consistently be used with `StandardCharsets` arguments instead of String encoding names. Also, there are `URLEncoder`/`URLDecoder` variants with a `Charset` argument in JDK 10+ now.

Oops, sorry for not noticing your PR before, @dreis2211 ... This consistency commit of mine only really covered a single URLEncoder case but the PR #27646 included some URLDecoder changes as well, next to the toString stuff.

If you could rebase #27554 against current main, we'll see how much we're still missing. From a quick glance, there are quite a few hard-coded `"UTF-8"` constants in use against `URLDecoder` still. It'd be great to apply your PR for that purpose!
