## 内容

Several integration options in our web support date back to the 2005 era, not having seen maintenance in recent years and apparently not getting an upgrade for Jakarta Servlet (in the `jakarta.servlet` package namespace). As part of our Jakarta EE 9+ revision, we'll therefore drop support for CommonsMultipartResolver, FreeMarkerServlet-style JSP taglib support and Tiles views.
