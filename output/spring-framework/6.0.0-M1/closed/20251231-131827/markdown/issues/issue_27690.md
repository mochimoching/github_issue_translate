When implementing the `WebApplicationInitializer` interface, the implementation is never called.
This was caused because [this file](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/main/spring-web/src/main/resources/META-INF/services/javax.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer) is still named with the old `javax` namespace. 

As a workaround, I just added the file with the `jakarta.servlet.ServletContainerInitializer` to my app.

Found that problem while working with Spring Security samples that use the [custom `WebApplicationInitializer` implementation](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security/blob/e398fbf2a7585c745a6a8d9d4ae6e980dff33462/web/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/web/context/AbstractSecurityWebApplicationInitializer.java#L74).
