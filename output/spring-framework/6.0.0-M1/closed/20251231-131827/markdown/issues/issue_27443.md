## 内容

Following up on #19628, we're finally removing RxJava 1.x support from Spring's `ReactiveAdapterRegistry` since it has been superseded not only by RxJava 2.x but even RxJava 3.x in the meantime.

As per a later note, we're also removing RxJava 2.x support right away since RxJava 2 reached EOL itself in February 2021 already.

Reopening for removing RxJava 2.x support - which reached EOL in February 2021 - as well, since it'll be 1.5 years by the time we go GA.
