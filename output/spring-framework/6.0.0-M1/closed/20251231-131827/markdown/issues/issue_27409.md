## 内容

As announced on the spring.io blog, [Spring Framework 6.0 will require JDK17 as a baseline](https://spring.io/blog/2021/09/02/a-java-17-and-jakarta-ee-9-baseline-for-spring-framework-6).

As a result, the default build pipeline should use JDK17 (with future variants for JDK18+) and the published artifacts should use the Java 17 language level.

This task should refactor the current CI pipeline to:
* only ship 17+ JDKs in the CI container image
* consistently use Java 17 language level for compiling main and test sources
* for now, Kotlin doesn't officially support Java 17, so we'll move to JDK 11 for now
