## 内容

Currently `WebClientResponseException` exposes the body as a `byte[]` or `String` and so does `RestClientResponseException`. It would be useful if these exposed convenience methods to decode an RFC 7807 formatted response to `ProblemDetail`. 

The exceptions could be created with a `Callable<ProblemDetail>` or similar to decouple them from the details of decoding, or perhaps the decoding could be done automatically for such a response and the ProblemDetail passed in to the exception.
