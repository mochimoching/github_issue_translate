## 内容

Jakarta EE 10 includes several significant additions to the Jakarta Concurrency API, including a `jakarta.enterprise.concurrent.Asynchronous` annotation similar to EJB's `jakarta.ejb.Asynchronous` which we detect as well. When the Jakarta Concurrency 3.0 API is present at runtime, we should aim for consistent auto-adapting.
