## 内容

This has been raised before, see #16747 and related (duplicate) issues, but was done under Spring Cloud instead, first as an [OpenFeign integration](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-openfeign) and more recently as a [Retrofit integration](https://github.com/spring-projects-experimental/spring-cloud-square).

The goal for this issue is first class support in the Spring Framework to create a client proxy from an annotated, HTTP service interface, since it is more generally applicable. Spring Cloud can then provide additional features around that. The same is also planned for RSocket with #24456. 

Methods on such an HTTP service interface will support many of the same [method arguments](https://docs.spring.io/spring-framework/docs/current/reference/html/web.html#mvc-ann-arguments) as for server side handling with `@RequestMapping` methods, but narrowing the choice down to those arguments that apply to both client and server side use. On the client side, argument values are used to populate the request, while on the server side, argument values are extracted from the request.

Methods of the HTTP service interface will require a new annotation, similar in purpose to `@RequestMapping`, but to declare an HTTP exchange in a way that is neutral to client or server perspective.
