## 内容

**Affects:** 5.3.13

---

I'm trying to run a unit test on my spring boot project using the HtmlUnit Webclient. 
The test does a POST Request submitting form data to the Controller which will create a database entry and send a redirect to the client. The response will contain a URL in the Location header which will be encoded if necessary.

Everything works fine until the HtmlUnit Webclient tries to follow the redirect and the `org.springframework.security.web.firewall.StrictHttpFirewall.getFirewalledRequest(HttpServletRequest)` method is called which prevents the request from being processed. It complains about the % in the URL (see stack trace).

But when running the application and using an actual browser the problem does not occur. Searching the web I found #16067 which first looked familiar.

So I wrote a small [project](https://github.com/thuri/encoded-uri-test) to reproduce the issue, and I think that the problem with HtmlUnit WebClient is a little bit different. 

When running the `webClientTestStringWithEncoding` test method and debugging into `org.springframework.security.web.firewall.StrictHttpFirewall#rejectedBlocklistedUrls(HttpServletRequest)`, one can see that `request.getServletPath()` still contains the encoded path while the called method `decodedUrlContains` seems to expect that it has been decoded.

If you run the `mockMvcTestURI` test method and debug the same line you can see that `request.getServletPath()` is empty but `request.getPathInfo()` contains an decoded path. `request.getRequestURI()` contains the encoded path in both cases.

In case you're wondering why the first test uses the webclient and the other one the mockMvc: I didn't find a way to pass either the encoded URL or the unencoded version (with spaces and an Umlaut) to the HtmlUnit Webclient (as you can see by the other test methods)

Perhaps the problem lies in the `org.springframework.test.web.servlet.htmlunit.HtmlUnitRequestBuilder.buildRequest(ServletContext)` where the `servletPath` is set on the request and should be decoded. 

I think I can work around that issue in my test but would be happy if you could have a look at this. 

Thanks in advance,

`HtmlUnitRequestBuilder` does not seem to support well URLs with encoded paths, including paths that are not encoded but become encoded when HtmlUnit's `WebClient` prepares a `java.net.URL`. The problem, as you pointed out, is that the servletPath is supposed to be decoded, but `HtmlUnitRequestBuilder` essentially [uses the full path](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/338f8907ac752718b9432ca268d9e6de25cba705/spring-test/src/main/java/org/springframework/test/web/servlet/htmlunit/HtmlUnitRequestBuilder.java#L411) minus any contextPath, and without further decoding.

One reason this might not have failed as much is that Boot apps have alwaysUseFullPath set by default so effectively the servletPath is not used for mapping purposes, so only Spring Security's firewall is affected.

I think this can be corrected. I don't see another alternative, and hopefully it shouldn't cause issues since the servletPath is not often used for mapping purposes and in any case it should be decoded.
