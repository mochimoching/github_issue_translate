## 内容

Currently `HttpServiceProxyFactory` is friendly for programmatic use but is more likely to be declared as a bean since it needs a number of dependencies injected such as as a `ConversionService`, and an `EmbeddedValueResolver` as of #28492. In a Boot application one would also inject `WebClient.Builder`.
