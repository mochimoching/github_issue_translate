## 内容

Currently `ApplicationContextAotGenerator` always generates a `__.BeanFactoryRegistrations` class. For context hierarchy support we're going to need multiple registration classes so we should use different names. We'd also like to be able to provide a target class so that we can use a package other than `__`.

The default classname is still generated in that `__` package. Is that expected? I was under the impression that this issue would move it at the same level as the application class itself.

We'll need to make some updates on the Boot side to pass the target in.
