## 内容

As of #28442, core Spring annotations are registered for native hints, including `@Order` and `@AliasFor`.

Spring optionally supports `jakarta.inject.Inject` and `jakarta.inject.Qualifier`, detecting their presence on the classpath. We should ensure that similar hints are registered if they are present on the classpath during the AOT phase.
