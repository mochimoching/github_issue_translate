## 内容

## Overview

`UrlResource` constructors throw checked exceptions which makes it difficult to use them in `java.util.Stream` and `java.util.Optional` APIs or other scenarios when a checked `IOException` is undesirable.

## Proposal

To support such use cases, we should introduce factory methods in `UrlResource` that throw `UncheckedIOException`, initially for the constructor variants that accept a `URI` or `String`.
