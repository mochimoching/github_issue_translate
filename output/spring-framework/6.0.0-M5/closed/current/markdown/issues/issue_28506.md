## 内容

In light of the findings from investigating #21515, we should introduce implicit support for scanning the module path whenever the `classpath*:` resource prefix is used.

This should allow existing applications relying on `classpath*:` semantics to work when migrating to the Java module system (for use cases not already supported by `ClassLoader`-based class path scanning).

For example, `@ComponentScan` should effectively work the same when an application is deployed on the class path or module path.

This issue has been resolved for inclusion in 6.0 M5.

In the interim, feel free to try out 6.0 snapshots for applications deployed with patched modules.

I've created a new repository for demonstrating the use of the Spring Framework with the Java Module System: https://github.com/sbrannen/spring-module-system

That repository currently contains a single `maven-surefire-patched-module` project which demonstrates support for `@ComponentScan` in a patched module using Maven Surefire.
