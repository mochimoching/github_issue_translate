## 内容

`@HttpExchange` is currently only allowed at the class level for inheriting common attributes, but at the method level one has to choose one of the HTTP method specific shortcut annotations. We can allow it at the method level for custom HTTP methods, or less common ones like OPTIONS which won't need a dedicated shortcut.
