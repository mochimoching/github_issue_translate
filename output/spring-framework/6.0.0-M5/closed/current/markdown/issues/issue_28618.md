## 内容

#28012 introduced support for cyclic annotation parameter types in Kotlin. However, in Kotlin 1.7 the compiler gives a warning for these cyclic parameters, which will turn into an error in Kotlin 1.9. See [KT-47932](https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/KT-47932).

We could theoretically keep supporting cyclic annotation parameters, but by this point it is clear that this feature was never intended to be there. So removal seems better.

Effectively, this would mean reverting https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/3ec612aaf8611d2ad6e6f7f3d5868feee5024477 and https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/commit/3188c0f7db54cffdb95e7127e2adde959dd078f9.
