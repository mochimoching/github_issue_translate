## 内容

While working on #28760, I noticed that `AnnotationTypeMapping.addConventionMappings()` actually adds convention-based mappings that it should not.

For example, in certain circumstances an explicit annotation attribute override configured via `@AliasFor` can be mapped as convention-based.

Although this does not _appear_ to cause negative side effects (other than unnecessary processing), this is technically a bug that should be addressed.

However, since there may be unknown use cases that somehow rely on the behavior of this bug, I currently only intend to apply the fix to 6.0.
