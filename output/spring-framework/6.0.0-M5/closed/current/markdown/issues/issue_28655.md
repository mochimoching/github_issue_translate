## 内容

If a field is flagged with `@Autowired` the container uses reflection to set the value. A hint should have been generated automatically for this but it looks like that's not the case at the moment.

This is a regression of a refactoring. We used to [flag a field regardless of its visibility](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/blob/4fe1eaddecaabb41b9fad3c7c5af786b9a68ab83/spring-beans/src/main/java/org/springframework/beans/factory/annotation/AutowiredAnnotationBeanPostProcessor.java#L863) and that is no longer the case.

A bit frustrating as the tests that were validating hints have been contributed have been dropped apparently.

Even more frustrating when I realize I was the one saying the hints was wrong in a review document 🙄
