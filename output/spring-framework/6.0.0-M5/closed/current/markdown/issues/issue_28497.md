## 内容

The core framework allows the use of `@AliasFor` which creates a JDK proxy behind the scenes. Registering a reflection hint for the attributes of the annotation is not enough for this to be used at runtime in a native image. 

To ease the registration, we'll add a utility that takes care of this logic.
