## 内容

This is a follow up to #28059.

Since R2DBC 1.0 has been released, we should upgrade and ensure compatibility with 1.0 for Spring Framework 6.0.

For example, `io.r2dbc.spi.Result.getRowsUpdated()` returned `Publisher<Integer>` in 0.9 and apparently returns `Publisher<Long>` in 1.0.
