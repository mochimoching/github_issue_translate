@snicoll have you thought about porting this update to spring-boot 3.x as there is [vulnerability in mysql-connector-j 9.2.0](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2025-30706) ?

I have not, thanks for pointing that out. Our [third-party dependencies policy](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/wiki/Supported-Versions#third-party-dependencies) is such that we don't upgrade to a new feature release of a dependency in a maintenance release of Spring Boot. That being said, @wilkinsona is mentioning that 9.2.0 is superseded by 9.3.0 so there's no point to stick to that version. 

I'll do the necessary shortly.
