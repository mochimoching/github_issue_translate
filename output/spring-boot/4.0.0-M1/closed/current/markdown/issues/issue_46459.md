## 内容

A test was [recently disabled](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/8fdf94c2c906e9553dd64808705a83d54e01dec4) due to a regression in Spring Batch. The regression has been fixed in the meantime, but the scenario we're testing is invalid and lead to a warning. Unfortunately, we can't fix the test to not produce the warning.

We should re-enable the test once https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/issues/4914 is fixed (and not used parameters).
