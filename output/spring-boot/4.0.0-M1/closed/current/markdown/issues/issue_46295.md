Shoulnd't `ZipkinTracingAutoConfiguration` have `@AutoConfiguration(afterName =  "org.springframework.boot.zipkin.autoconfigure.ZipkinAutoConfiguration")` as well? Besides the condition, I mean.

Looking at the smoke test that's failing, and the inconsistent condition, let's go ahead with the above.

Leaving the meeting label on for now as Phil wanted to "double check in our next team meeting that the class is in the correct place. I think it is since the tracing module configures tracing for a bunch of tech and you can use Zipkin without Micrometer tracing".
