Will this upgrade also be backported to the `3.4.x` and `3.5.x` branches? Those branches currently use version 1.3.8, which doesn't correctly shade `protobuf-java` (https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/issues/1431), which was fixed in [1.3.9](https://github.com/prometheus/client_java/releases/tag/v1.3.9).
