While the idea has been discussed in the past, it hasn’t gained traction, largely because:\n\n* We haven’t seen any demand from users for LTS releases.\n* Apache Commons follows strict semantic versioning, so upgrading to a newer minor release (e.g., from `3.17.0` to `3.18.0`) is generally considered safe and non-breaking. Of course, an LTS release could offer additional reassurance in more conservative environments.\n\nAs for releasing a patched `3.17.1`, that would ultimately depend on our release manager’s availability (cc @garydgregory). However, it's unlikely for a couple of reasons:\n\n* Version `3.18.0` already contains the fix for the CVE in question.\n* The vulnerability (CVE-2025-48924) is not exploitable in most applications. Specifically, `ClassUtils.getName` is rarely reachable.\n\nIf there's interest, we could publish VEX (Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange) statements clarifying the reachability and risk of this CVE in other Apache Commons components. For reference, see [this thread on `dev@commons`](https://lists.apache.org/thread/b1ckyw1fg36v6mh8n6wx5vdsj6gxkdfx). We're also open to coordinating with other OSS projects on this, subject to our time availability.\n"

However, scanners are seldom sofisticated per default, so I bet many users and companies will have to modify their vulnerability scanning policies based on this decision. \n\nIn my world, unfortunately, we will most likely not be able to upgrade spring boot until 4.0 is released several months from now. \n\nThe reason why I think it is an important subject is that historically in other open source projects, stuff will decay over time. As an example, consider the [official postgresql docker image](https://hub.docker.com/layers/library/postgres/latest/images/sha256-2839b0a05edad90502d2b070b4b84ff9111d5ffa1cd6dc265ca434c8219f27f6): For years, the image has been flagged as vulnerable, for instance on Dockerhub (as linked), with SNYK or similar.  \n\n(btw an interesting case because the original author of gosu package used refuses to rebuild the package because in his perspective it contains no security issues)\n\nHowever, in my experience, customers and project teams will use time to discuss each vulnerability individually. This is my interest in having no security issues flagged in projects like Spring Boot. \n\nOf course I respect your position, and acknowledge that it will be extra work to maintain branches if minor versions of dependencies also should be considered as fixes. And if possible, I agree that the optimal place to fix is to push back to the beginning of the the chain. "

        "body": "@jesperronn,\n\nI think the real improvement needed here is in **security scanners**, not necessarily in how Spring Boot manages dependency versions or Apache Commons makes security releases.\n\n## 1. Security-conscious companies\n\nYou clearly work for a company that takes security seriously, running scans on every release (which, believe me, is not the norm). When a scan flags a vulnerable dependency, two scenarios arise:\n\n### **A. Exploitable vulnerability**\n\nIf the vulnerability is *actually exploitable*, you can bump the dependency in your **own** application and verify everything still works. You don’t need to wait for Spring Boot to release an updated `spring-boot-dependencies`: it’s a **suggestion list**, not a guarantee of security.\n\nUnless you have a support contract that explicitly promises zero vulnerabilities in `spring-boot-dependencies`, it’s still your team’s responsibility to ensure your app is “without known exploitable vulnerabilities” (to borrow the EU CRA terminology).\n\nYes, pinning dependencies is extra work, but you likely already do it for libraries not managed by Spring Boot.\n\n### **B. Not exploitable vulnerability**\n\nMany scan results are **false positives** because:\n\n* Most scanners cannot assess *exploitability*.\n* Vendors benefit from reporting a high number of “issues” for marketing purposes.\n\nThe first problem is solvable.\n\n### Apache Commons example\n\nWithin Apache Commons, we’ve been experimenting with **VEX files** for CVE-2025-48924:\n\n* Commons BCEL – *not exploitable*: [https://github.com/apache/commons-bcel/tree/master/src/conf/security](https://github.com/apache/commons-bcel/tree/master/src/conf/security)\n* Commons Compress – *not exploitable*: [https://github.com/apache/commons-compress/tree/master/src/conf/security](https://github.com/apache/commons-compress/tree/master/src/conf/security)\n* Commons Configuration – *only exploitable if security guidelines are ignored*: [https://github.com/apache/commons-configuration/tree/master/src/conf/security](https://github.com/apache/commons-configuration/tree/master/src/conf/security)\n* Commons Text – *only exploitable if security guidelines are ignored*: [https://github.com/apache/commons-text/tree/master/src/conf/security](https://github.com/apache/commons-text/tree/master/src/conf/security)\n\nI used these to show that Apache Solr (with \\~400 dependencies) was *not* affected: apache/solr-site#152.\n\nWe don’t advertise these on our website yet, but we’ll make every effort to keep them current for any OSS or commercial security scanner provider interested in testing them.\n\n### Tools that can help\n\nThe open-source **SecObserve** scanner is working on supporting VEX files from dependencies (MaibornWolff/SecObserve#3177). Supporting this kind of tooling is, in my opinion, time well spent.\n\n## 2. Non security-conscious companies\n\nYour concerns are more relevant for companies that **don’t** run regular scans. For them, having `spring-boot-dependencies` always point to “no known vulnerabilities” is indeed useful.\n\nHowever, these companies rarely contribute back, either in code or financially. Since every release costs time (whether volunteer time in Apache Commons or paid time in Spring Boot), both projects have to prioritise work that benefits the broader community or their employer.\n\nThis means Apache Commons is unlikely to publish patch-only security releases solely for organisations that don’t actively manage their own security posture, just so Spring Boot can update the version in `spring-boot-dependencies`.\n"

Situations with two different dependencies are very rarely the same, particularly when security vulnerabilities are involved. We have to weigh up several factors, including:\n\n- the potential distruption of the upgrade\n- the severity of the vulneratbility\n- the ease with which the vulnerability can be exploited\n- how widely used the dependency may be\n\nConsidering these factors among others and the fact that Spring Boot's dependency management is only an opinion and can be overridden means that different dependencies will be treated differently and different vulnerabilities in the same dependency will also be treated differently."
