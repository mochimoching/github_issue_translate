    "body": "The Spring Boot OpenTelemetry Starter has mixed support for the OpenTelemetry APIs.\n\nIt would be useful to document this in the [OpenTelemetry Support](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/4.0-SNAPSHOT/reference/actuator/observability.html#actuator.observability.opentelemetry) section of the docs.\n\n| Aspect | OpenTelemetry API | OpenTelemetry Exporter API | OTLP | OpenTelemetry Environment Variables Spec |\n|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|\n| Logging | ✅ |✅* |✅* |⚠️ |\n| Metrics | ❌ |❌ |✅ |⚠️ |\n| Tracing | ✅ |✅ |✅ |⚠️ |\n\n_* No log is actually collected nor exported, since there is no support in Spring Boot for bridging logs from SLF4J/Logback/Log4J._\n\nThe key part is that metrics are only supported when registered via the Micrometer API. The OpenTelemetry Metrics API can be used to register metrics (since it's in the classpath), but all the metrics registered in that way will be ignored (as decided in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/36546). So it's a potential source of confusion and something I'd recommend documenting. One of the consequence of this situation, is that the Resource API-related config used for logs and traces is not shared with the metrics support (related issue: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/46229).\n\nOn the other hand, there is support for registering traces both via OpenTelemetry Tracing API and Micrometer Tracing API. That adds on the confusion since support for the two observability signals is not consistent.\n\nAnother difference is in how the observability signals can be exported. For logs and traces, there is suppport for the OpenTelemetry Exporter API (only the OTLP implementation is supported by Spring Boot, but a developer could plug in a different implementation on their own). For metrics, there is not. Furthermore, logs are not collected from SLF4J/Logback/Log4J, so no log is actually exported (though, the plumbing is there for developers to add this feature on their own using the OpenTelemetry Java Instrumentation). \n\nFinally, support for the OpenTelemetry Environment Variables specification is partially supported for the Resource API and a few more cases, but most environment variables are not supported. It would be nice to document which ones are supported (related issue: https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/47646).\n",

Please take the time to review the following\ncategories as some of them do not apply here.\n\n🙅 \"Please DO NOT Raise an Issue\" Cases\n- Question\nSTOP!! Please ask questions about how to use something, or to understand why something isn't\nworking as you expect it to, on Stack Overflow using the spring-boot tag.\n- Security Vulnerability\nSTOP!! Please don't raise security vulnerabilities here. Head over to https://spring.io/security-policy to learn how to disclose them responsibly.\n- Managed Dependency Upgrade\nYou DO NOT need to raise an issue for a managed dependency version upgrade as there's a semi-automatic process for checking managed dependencies for new versions before a release. BUT pull requests for upgrades that are more involved than just a version property change are still most welcome.\n- With an Immediate Pull Request\nAn issue will be closed as a duplicate of the immediate pull request, so you don't have to raise an issue if you plan to create a pull request immediately.\n\n🐞 Bug report (please don't include this emoji/text, just add your details)\nPlease provide details of the problem, including the version of Spring Boot that you\nare using. If possible, please provide a test case or sample application that reproduces\nthe problem. This makes it much easier for us to diagnose the problem and to verify that\nwe have fixed it.\n\n🎁 Enhancement (please don't include this emoji/text, just add your details)\nPlease start by describing the problem that you are trying to solve. There may already\nbe a solution, or there may be a way to solve it that you hadn't considered.\n\n\nTIP: You can always edit your issue if it isn't formatted correctly.\n     See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown \n-->\n\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/47272 added back the previous EnvironmentPostProcessor in deprecated form, but the implementation (https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/3a9ab1569616c31d58d7f7b3e6ff9c8c364a9360) seems incomplete.\n\nThe following fails:\n\n```java\nimport org.junit.jupiter.api.Test;\nimport org.springframework.boot.SpringApplication;\nimport org.springframework.boot.bootstrap.ConfigurableBootstrapContext;\nimport org.springframework.boot.env.EnvironmentPostProcessor;\nimport org.springframework.boot.logging.DeferredLogFactory;\nimport org.springframework.boot.test.context.SpringBootTest;\nimport org.springframework.core.env.ConfigurableEnvironment;\nimport org.springframework.util.Assert;\n\n@SpringBootTest\nclass DemoApplicationTests {\n\n\t@Test\n\tvoid contextLoads() {\n\t}\n\n    static class DeprecatedEnvironmentPostProcessor implements EnvironmentPostProcessor {\n\n        public DeprecatedEnvironmentPostProcessor(DeferredLogFactory logFactory, ConfigurableBootstrapContext bootstrapContext) {\n            Assert.notNull(logFactory, \"logFactory must not be null\");\n            Assert.notNull(bootstrapContext, \"bootstrapContext must not be null\");\n        }\n\n        @Override\n        public void postProcessEnvironment(ConfigurableEnvironment environment, SpringApplication application) {\n\n        }\n\n    }\n\n}\n```\n\nI had expected that the deprecated `EnvironmentPostProcessor` continue to work, but fails due to null constructor arguments.\n\nLooks like the call to load the deprecated `EnvironmentPostProcessor` missed providing the `ArgumentResolver` as it does for the non-deprecated variant:\n\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/c7ec1fa7345b7667f8fe07e2d37689ae63d918f3/core/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/support/SpringFactoriesEnvironmentPostProcessorsFactory.java#L55\n\nhttps://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/c7ec1fa7345b7667f8fe07e2d37689ae63d918f3/core/spring-boot/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/support/SpringFactoriesEnvironmentPostProcessorsFactory.java#L63\n",

This is due to it using Tomcat 11 that includes [this change](https://github.com/apache/tomcat/commit/69eff83577f7c00cbaaca9384ab4b1989f516797) that affects response processing and when the response is sent to the client. With that change in Tomcat 11, the response is now closed when the number of bytes written is greater than or equal to the expected content length. Closing the response allows it to be sent to the client and this is happening earlier than it did with Tomcat 10.1 and, crucially, before the timer has been registered. Sending the response before the timer has been registered initiates a race between the response being received on the client side, which causes the test to proceed and look for the timer, and the timer being registered on the server side.\n\nThe test can be made to fail reliably by configuring it with an artificially slow meter registry:\n\n```java\n@Bean\nSimpleMeterRegistry simpleMeterRegistry() {\n\treturn new SimpleMeterRegistry() {\n\n\t\t@Override\n\t\tprotected Timer newTimer(Id id, DistributionStatisticConfig distributionStatisticConfig,\n\t\t\t\tPauseDetector pauseDetector) {\n\t\t\ttry {\n\t\t\t\tThread.sleep(2500);\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tcatch (InterruptedException ex) {\n\t\t\t\tThread.currentThread().interrupt();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\treturn super.newTimer(id, distributionStatisticConfig, pauseDetector);\n\t\t}\n\n\t};\n}\n```"

On cloud deployment, it is advised to not use sniff explained in [When not to sniff?](https://www.elastic.co/blog/elasticsearch-sniffing-best-practices-what-when-why-how). Spring Boot 4 enabled it by default.

This goes against some of the [promises of modularization](https://spring.io/blog/2025/10/28/modularizing-spring-boot#why-modularize-the-codebase).\n\nAdditionally, _runtime_ modules introduced by that commit are in reality starter modules (as they hold no actual code) pretending to be actual modules. This sets a bad precedent, as it raises questions about what qualifies as a module vs a starter.\n\nI didn't review the full codebase to whether there are other occurrences of this pattern, but my expectation around modules would be that they:\n\n- hold code that integrates given technology in Spring Boot\n- transitively pull in only minimal dependencies using appropriate dependency configuration while declaring non-essential ones as optional\n- are combined with other dependencies (based on some opinion) in starters\n\nI understand the goal of the https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/issues/46944 was to make WAR deployments easier, but it shouldn't be done at the expense of other use cases. Did you perhaps consider having dedicated starters that hold opinion about WAR deployments?\n\nI focused only on `spring-boot-tomcat` in this issue, but analogous concerns apply to `spring-boot-jetty`.",

It's been pretty hard to find an arrangement that works for all users and all build systems.\n\nWe discussed this issue this morning on our team call and were going to roll-back the change, but I think I've found another way to make it work by making the runtime modules starters. I've tested this setup manually using https://github.com/philwebb/gh-46944 and it appears to work.\n\nThe rest of the team will probably want to review this before we release 4.0.0, but 🤞 this works and also solves your concerns.

Please ask questions about how to use something, or to understand why something isn't\nworking as you expect it to, on Stack Overflow using the spring-boot tag.\n- Security Vulnerability\nSTOP!! Please don't raise security vulnerabilities here. Head over to https://spring.io/security-policy to learn how to disclose them responsibly.\n- Managed Dependency Upgrade\nYou DO NOT need to raise an issue for a managed dependency version upgrade as there's a semi-automatic process for checking managed dependencies for new versions before a release. BUT pull requests for upgrades that are more involved than just a version property change are still most welcome.\n- With an Immediate Pull Request\nAn issue will be closed as a duplicate of the immediate pull request, so you don't have to raise an issue if you plan to create a pull request immediately.\n\n🐞 Bug report (please don't include this emoji/text, just add your details)\nPlease provide details of the problem, including the version of Spring Boot that you\nare using. If possible, please provide a test case or sample application that reproduces\nthe problem. This makes it much easier for us to diagnose the problem and to verify that\nwe have fixed it.\n\n🎁 Enhancement (please don't include this emoji/text, just add your details)\nPlease start by describing the problem that you are trying to solve. There may already\nbe a solution, or there may be a way to solve it that you hadn't considered.\n\n\nTIP: You can always edit your issue if it isn't formatted correctly.\n     See https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown \n-->\nHi, I was looking into the history of @AutoConfigureWebClient(registerRestTemplate=true). I saw AutoConfigureWebClient was renamed to AutoConfigureRestClient (awesome) and registerRestTemplate was removed in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/9eb05ebb102b17e9680706169d36aa52b7e8ac73 with @philwebb  looking into the naming side of things. \n\n\nI still see \n```\nmodule/spring-boot-restclient-test/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json:      \"name\": \"spring.test.webclient.register-rest-template\",\n```\nthis could be cleaned up I guess ?\n\nAlso it seems like in 2016 (springboot 1.4.0 wow) when AutoConfigureWebClient was created, the word \"webclient\" didn't mean webflux, it was more like a generic word. And so in 2016, AutoConfigureWebClient along with MockRestServiceServerAutoConfiguration were created with properties in the `spring.test.webclient` namespace, so maybe \"spring.test.webclient.mockrestserviceserver\" can be renamed as well ? I don't know what consequences this has at all so maybe it's not possible\n\nFor info, using `git grep 'spring\\.test\\.webcl'`\nv3.5.6 has\n```\n@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty(\"spring.test.webclient.mockrestserviceserver.enabled\")\n@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty(\"spring.test.webclient.register-rest-template\")\n```\nmain currently only has\n```\n@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty(\"spring.test.webclient.mockrestserviceserver.enabled\")\n```\nso renaming it would remove this last trace of things that have webclient in their name but are not related to webflux webclient.\n(this ambiguous naming is what sent me to this rabbithole in the first place)\n\nI'm not an expert so maybe I misunderstood all of this, if so please ignore/close this issue ",
