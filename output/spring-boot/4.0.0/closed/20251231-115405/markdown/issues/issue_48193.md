Hi, I was looking into the history of @AutoConfigureWebClient(registerRestTemplate=true). I saw AutoConfigureWebClient was renamed to AutoConfigureRestClient (awesome) and registerRestTemplate was removed in https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/commit/9eb05ebb102b17e9680706169d36aa52b7e8ac73 with @philwebb  looking into the naming side of things. 


I still see 
```
module/spring-boot-restclient-test/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring-configuration-metadata.json:      "name": "spring.test.webclient.register-rest-template",
```
this could be cleaned up I guess ?

Also it seems like in 2016 (springboot 1.4.0 wow) when AutoConfigureWebClient was created, the word "webclient" didn't mean webflux, it was more like a generic word. And so in 2016, AutoConfigureWebClient along with MockRestServiceServerAutoConfiguration were created with properties in the `spring.test.webclient` namespace, so maybe "spring.test.webclient.mockrestserviceserver" can be renamed as well ? I don't know what consequences this has at all so maybe it's not possible

For info, using `git grep 'spring\.test\.webcl'`
v3.5.6 has
```
@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty("spring.test.webclient.mockrestserviceserver.enabled")
@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty("spring.test.webclient.register-rest-template")
```
main currently only has
```
@ConditionalOnBooleanProperty("spring.test.webclient.mockrestserviceserver.enabled")
```
so renaming it would remove this last trace of things that have webclient in their name but are not related to webflux webclient.
(this ambiguous naming is what sent me to this rabbithole in the first place)

I'm not an expert so maybe I misunderstood all of this, if so please ignore/close this issue
