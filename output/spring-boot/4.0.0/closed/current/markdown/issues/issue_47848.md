## 内容

At the moment, `spring-boot-elasticsearch` provides support for auto-configuring a `ReactiveElasticsearchClient`. `ReactiveElasticsearchClient` is part of Spring Data Elasticsearch so, arguably, the auto-configuration support should be in `spring-boot-data-elasticsearch`. One downside of moving it would be that it becomes harder to have an auto-configured reactive client without also getting auto-configured reactive data repositories. I think that's an edge case though so I'm in favor of the move.
