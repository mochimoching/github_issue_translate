## 内容

As of https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-framework/issues/35733, Spring Framework has a dedicated method for configuring a Kotlin Serialization converter specifically.

We should reflect that in our `DefaultClientHttpMessageConvertersCustomizer` to use this new method.

I was just about to ask what would be the impact in Boot after the Framework change, and I saw this issue.

> if an application has Kotlin Serialization on the classpath, it is expected to use a dedicated converter for serializing @Serializable types.

Is the newly introduced starter still going to be needed after this ticket is addressed? I understood just having the library in the classpath was not enough, but after this comment in the framework issue, I'm a bit unsure about the starter actually doing anything.

@bcmedeiros yes this change is still required and the dedicated module is important: this is what allows you to [use configuration properties](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/blob/75cfe82bd7c8a7ecf2ae4f0bfe3a55c06ac0759e/module/spring-boot-kotlin-serialization/src/main/java/org/springframework/boot/kotlin/serialization/autoconfigure/KotlinSerializationProperties.java) to drive the creation of the `Json` instance and the Kotlin Serialization converter itself.

As part of this, we should remove `@Order(-10) // configured ahead of JSON mappers` from the Kotlin converter's `@Bean` method.

@bclozel should a similar change also be applied to `DefaultServerHttpMessageConvertersCustomizer`?
